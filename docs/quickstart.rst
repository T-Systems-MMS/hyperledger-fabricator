Our example includes 3 organizations, each generates their crypto material individually stored in their independent folders (in case of local setup)or in their independent machines (in case of multi-machine setup).

Each organization joins the channel and deploy chaincode on it. We will make each organization join our network one by one.

The containers in this example can be deployed in single machine containing all 3 orgs or 3 distinct machines (1 for each org) which are in the same network.
